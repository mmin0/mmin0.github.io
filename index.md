Hello! Iâ€™m Ming Min, a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate at [Department of Statistics & Applied Probability](http://www.pstat.ucsb.edu), University of California, Santa Barbara, CA. I am currently doing a Machine Learning Engineer summer internship at TikTok.

I'm interested in stochastic analysis and their application in Machine Learning, eg. develop efficient algorithm based on **Rough Path** theory to solve Mean Field Games with common noise\[[ICML'21](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/min21a.html)\]. <!-- For more details, please check my [CV](cv-2021.pdf). -->   

Before joining UCSB, I got my M.S. in Financial Mathematics from [Department of Mathematical Science, Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/mathematical-sciences) in 2018, Massachusetts, US. In WPI, I was fortunately advised by Prof. [Stephan Sturm](http://users.wpi.edu/~ssturm/) and working on Numerical Methods for Option Pricing with Backward Stochastic Differential Equations(BSDEs). I received my B.S. in Business Administration from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://english.bupt.edu.cn) in 2016, Beijing, China.
