Hello! Iâ€™m Ming Min, a Ph.D. in Statistics and Applied Probability supervised by Professor Tomoyuki Ichiba at [Department of Statistics & Applied Probability](http://www.pstat.ucsb.edu), University of California, Santa Barbara, CA. I have done a Machine Learning Engineer 2022 summer internship at TikTok. 

During my PhD, I'm interested in stochastic analysis and their application in Machine Learning, eg. develop efficient algorithm based on **Rough Path** theory to solve Mean Field Games with common noise\[[ICML'21](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/min21a.html)\], design novel time series generator by Directed Chain stochastic differential process\[[ICML '23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13131)\] etc. <!-- For more details, please check my [CV](cv-2021.pdf). -->   

Before joining UCSB, I got my M.S. in Financial Mathematics from [Department of Mathematical Science, Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/mathematical-sciences) in 2018, Massachusetts, US, where I was fortunately advised by Prof. [Stephan Sturm](http://users.wpi.edu/~ssturm/) and working on Numerical Methods for Option Pricing with Backward Stochastic Differential Equations(BSDEs). I received my B.S. in Business Administration from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://english.bupt.edu.cn) in 2016, Beijing, China.
