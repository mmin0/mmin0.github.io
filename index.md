Hello! Iâ€™m Ming Min, a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate at [Department of Statistics & Applied Probability](http://www.pstat.ucsb.edu){:target="_blank"}, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA. 

I'm interested in **financial mathematics**, including **portfolio optimization**, **derivatives pricing** and **mean field games**. Recently, I'm working on **signature**, **rough path theory**, **Stochastic Filtering on Directed Chain SDEs** and their application in data science. For more details, please check my [curriculum vitae](cv-2021.pdf){:target="_blank"}. 

Before joining UCSB, I got my M.S. in Financial Mathematics from [Department of Mathematical Science, Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/mathematical-sciences){:target="_blank"} in 2018, Massachusetts, US. In WPI, I was fortunately advised by Prof. [Stephan Sturm](http://users.wpi.edu/~ssturm/) and working on Numerical Methods for Option Pricing with Backward Stochastic Differential Equations(BSDEs). 

I received my B.S. in Business Administration from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://english.bupt.edu.cn){:target="_blank"} in 2016, Beijing, China.
