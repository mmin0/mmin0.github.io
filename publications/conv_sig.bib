	Abstract = {Signature is an infinite graded sequence of statistics known to characterize geometric rough paths. While the use of the signature in machine learning is successful in low-dimensional cases, it suffers from the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional cases, as the number of features in the truncated signature transform grows exponentially fast. With the idea of Convolutional Neural Network, we propose a novel neural network to address this problem. Our model reduces the number of features efficiently in a data-dependent way. Some empirical experiments including high-dimensional financial time series classification and natural language processing are provided to support our convolutional signature model.},
